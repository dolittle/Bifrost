# Issues

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

Bifrost has a default issue template when you create an issue in GitHub.
The template is targetting bugs. For any bugs or problems, please follow the template.

## Committing

When you're committing you can reference issues with hashtag # - and the number of the issue.
This will link the issue and the commit and the commit will show up as a comment on the
issue. This is very useful for transparency and helps on discussing.

## Branching

Creating a branch per issue is a good practice, this isolates the changes you're doing and relates
it to the issue. Name it so that it is clear which issue the branch is for; issue/# - e.g. issue/712.

## Pull requests

Since your branches are named according to the issue it is solving, it will be clear in the pull request.
